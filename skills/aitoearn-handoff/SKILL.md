# Aitoearn Handoff

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save it to a path produced by `mktemp -t handoff-XXXXXX.md` (read the file before you write to it).

Suggest the skills to be used, if any, by the next session.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (PRDs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
