## 1. Standalone HTML Coverage Meeting Brief

Use when HTML is requested or selected for an introductory coverage, management, CFO, investor-relations, or relationship-development meeting. Follow `../../plugin-support/references/html-artifact-standard.md`. The artifact should help the banker run a credible conversation and earn a next step, not look like a diligence request list for an active process.

First-read hierarchy:

1. **Meeting objective and recommended posture.** State the relationship objective, why the dialogue matters now, and the appropriate banker stance without implying a financing need, M&A process, or mandate.
2. **Must-know snapshot.** Present a compact set of sourced metrics or strategic facts that shape the conversation, including dates and company-defined metric labels where relevant.
3. **Coverage angles and mandate triggers.** Explain the small number of strategic angles worth testing and what management response would make follow-up work relevant.
4. **Questions to land.** Use one consolidated prioritized table, normally three to five core questions with focused evidence asks. If useful, include no more than two or three conditional follow-up prompts, each tied to a management signal surfaced during the meeting.
5. **Talk track and guardrails.** Include a suggested opening, transition, close, internal-only do-not-say guidance when appropriate, and missing meeting/relationship context to confirm.
6. **Permissioned next step and sources.** Present one recommended permissioned next step. Include no more than two alternatives only when distinct mandate triggers would justify different follow-up work, plus a readable evidence/limitations section.

Do not repeat growth, M&A, and capital-markets questions across three extensive tables when one integrated sequence will run the conversation better. Do not add a generic dashboard shell, related-file controls, visible render inputs, or an exhaustive diligence register solely because the output is HTML.
