## Style standard

Write like a senior restructuring banker:

- Put the answer at the top.
- Use ranges, not false precision, when inputs are uncertain.
- Explain what matters and why.
- Identify the decision, not just the math.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations.
- Use readable tables for recoveries, alternatives, and diligence gaps.
- Flag legal conclusions for counsel review.

## Standalone HTML restructuring memo

Use this as the default reader-facing deliverable for debtor-side sale-path, restructuring-alternatives, and board-recommendation analysis. Follow `../../plugin-support/references/html-artifact-standard.md`; this skill owns its standalone HTML memo rather than packaging ordinary narrative work through `dashboard-builder`.

Recommended first-read sequence:

1. Recommendation, audience, source cutoff, and board-readiness posture.
2. Decision gates: the few unresolved facts that prevent or support reliance.
3. DIP and transaction perimeter: cash, credit bid, assumed liabilities, liens, fees, cure, and process conditions.
4. Value bridge and value-break analysis: clearly distinguish estate proceeds from illustrative residual value.
5. Recovery sensitivity and practical fulcrum, with allowed-claim and collateral limitations visible.
6. Alternatives and higher-and-better process requirements.
7. Board information request, counsel/valuation flags, sources, and posture conclusion.

Design and evidence rules:

- Use a restrained memo layout with a clear recommendation and compact decision tables, not dashboard navigation, copy/export controls, or a related-files panel.
- Put the board-decision gates before detailed claim and sensitivity schedules.
- Show source citations close to material terms and workbook cell/range support for displayed calculated outputs without covering the opening view in citation badges.
- Describe visible evidence as `Executed DIP agreement`, `Filed asset purchase agreement`, `Company disclosure`, `Analyst calculation`, `Illustrative sensitivity`, or `Not yet supported`; retain internal codes in support data or handoffs only.
- Treat known-funded-GUC-only percentages or thresholds as upper-bound sensitivities before additional allowed claims; do not present them as distributable recovery.
- Render and visually inspect the opening view plus value-break/recovery and board-gates sections through local headless-browser screenshots before delivery.

## Quick-read format

Use only when the user explicitly needs a fast answer, live meeting prep, or triage against thin source context.

## Structured handoff packages

Use `../../plugin-support/references/handoff-contracts.md` when restructuring analysis feeds another Investment Banking skill:

- `distressed_recovery_waterfall_to_memo_builder`
- `distressed_recovery_waterfall_to_pitch_deck_builder`
- `distressed_recovery_waterfall_to_ib_deck_qc`

All three preserve the same restructuring core: mandate context, client/stakeholder perspective, jurisdiction/process stage, source scope, capital structure, claim register, legal entity/guarantor/collateral map, valuation cases, distributable value bridge, recovery waterfall, recovery ranges by class, value-break class, fulcrum security, stakeholder leverage, alternatives, recommended path, diligence gaps, counsel/specialist flags, key numbers to tie, open items, and circulation caveats.

The QC package also carries artifact version, review scope, waterfall tie-outs, valuation case tie-outs, scenario outputs, assumption register, model status, QA checks, and confidentiality/disclosure flags.

## Example language

Strong language:

- "Base-case value breaks in the second-lien notes; they are the economic fulcrum and likely plan-anchor constituency."
- "The fulcrum conclusion is not robust because a modest EBITDA or multiple downside moves impairment into the first-lien term loan."
- "Unsecured notes are out of the money on strict entitlement but may have settlement value if they can credibly litigate valuation or plan classification."
- "The company should not launch a second-lien-led RSA without either making first lien whole or offering first lien credible takeback paper."
- "This is an illustrative waterfall until collateral, guarantor, and intercreditor terms are reviewed."

Avoid weak language:

- "The model says recovery is 52.3 percent" without explaining sensitivity.
- "This plan is confirmable" unless counsel has provided that conclusion.
- "Secured debt recovers 100 percent" without collateral coverage.
- "Equity is definitely worthless" if valuation range or litigation status is uncertain.
