# Slide Blueprint Schema

Use this schema only after the deck plan has been approved, stabilized, or otherwise accepted as the controlling page plan.

This is the lower-level slide construction contract for generating or handing off editable presentation pages. It translates the approved page plan into slide-by-slide build instructions: action title, executive takeaway, construction-ready visual choice, content blocks, source references, caveats, and downstream handoffs.

Do not use this schema as the user-facing deck plan or first-pass page architecture. For the user-facing structured handoff, use `output-schema.md` and validate with [`scripts/validate_deck_plan_json.py`](../scripts/validate_deck_plan_json.py). Once that plan is stable, use this blueprint to specify how the presentation should actually be built.

Use this mode only when a downstream tool, agent, or native deck builder needs construction-ready instructions. A blueprint should include executive takeaway, content blocks, visual type, data needed, source IDs, status, and handoffs. Do not use a blueprint to hide unresolved storyline choices, weak sourcing, or missing MD review.

## Validation rules

- Blueprint should represent a stabilized lower-level construction spec, not an initial user-facing page plan.
- Include `plan_status` and `plan_reference` when available so builders can trace the blueprint back to the approved deck plan.
- Deck must have at least one slide.
- `deck_type` must be one of: `buyer_pitch`, `sell_side_pitch`, `financing_pitch`, `strategic_alternatives`, `company_profile`, `market_map`, `board_client_meeting`.
- Each slide must have an action title, purpose, recommended visual, status, and executive takeaway.
- Slides with `ready` status must have at least one source or explicit `banker_view` / `model_derived` label.
- `placeholder` and `needs_source` slides must not be presented as final.
- Metrics in content blocks should reference source IDs when available.
- Preserve blueprint-native `evidence_label` values. When handing blueprints to another Investment Banking skill, add `canonical_evidence_category` from `../../plugin-support/references/evidence-label-taxonomy.md` rather than replacing local labels. For example, `banker_view` maps to `inference`, `source_derived` maps to `estimate`, and `placeholder` maps to `unknown`.

## Slide content rules

- Title must state the answer or implication.
- Body must support the title; remove details that do not support the message.
- Include only metrics that matter for the client decision.
- Use chart/table visuals when they clarify the story; do not over-table pages.
- Put citations, footnotes, and source notes in a consistent location.
- Keep placeholders explicit: `[needs source]`, `[client assumption]`, `[banker judgment]`, `[to be confirmed]`.
- Include appendix pages only for support, not to bury important logic.
