# Remotion Saas

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

One can build apps with Remotion.  
It is possible to have a simple form and hook it up to a render, or have a complex video editor.

## Choosing a template or a framework

We have several templates for SaaS which can be cloned or used as a reference.
See [Choosing a framework](framework.md) for help choosing a template or framework. 

## The `<Player>`

This component allows embedding a Remotion preview in a React app. See [Player](player.md) for more information about the Player.

## Rendering

There are client-side and server-side rendering options available. See [Rendering](rendering.md) for advice on how to choose, and about the Lambda, Vercel, Node.js and Cloudflare options.
