# HTML Ppt Retro Quarterly Review

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

A high-contrast, print-inspired quarterly review template with three cinematic
slides:

1. Cover (hero title lockup)
2. Three priorities (triptych grid)
3. Roadmap timeline + KPI strip

## Resource map

```text

└── example.html
```

## Workflow

1. Read active `DESIGN.md` first and map any requested token changes into CSS
   variables while preserving the retro blue/orange/cream visual grammar.
2. Start from `assets/template.html`; do not rebuild from scratch.
3. Preserve the three-slide information architecture and typographic hierarchy.
4. Keep interactions and motion quality:
   - keyboard `1/2/3` quick jump
   - `R` restart
   - page indicator updates per scene
   - premium wipe transitions and staggered reveals
5. Keep output self-contained (single HTML, inline CSS + JS, no framework runtime).
6. If adapting copy/data, keep content realistic and internally consistent.
7. Validate against `references/checklist.md` before emitting artifact.

## Output contract

Emit one short orientation sentence and then the artifact:

```xml
<artifact identifier="retro-quarterly-review" type="text/html" title="Retro Quarterly Review">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```
