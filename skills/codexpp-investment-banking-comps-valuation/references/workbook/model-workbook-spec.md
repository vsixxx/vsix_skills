## Workbook principles

- Keep raw data separate from normalized outputs.
- Use an insight-led first visible tab named `Executive Summary`, `Cover`, or `Dashboard`, then a single `Control` tab for valuation date, currency, source hierarchy, fiscal basis, and scenario selections.
- Avoid hardcoded values inside formulas. Place assumptions in clearly marked input cells.
- Every output should trace back to source data, assumptions, and formulas.
- Use consistent row order across data tabs so peer formulas can be audited quickly.
- Build for refreshability: formulas should copy across peer rows and update from clearly defined inputs.

## Operating mode procedures

### Build from scratch

1. Create the workbook shell using the user's template or `scripts/create_comps_template.py --output-dir <path>`.
2. Populate `Control` with target, valuation date, currency, fiscal-year-end, and model objective.
3. Build the initial universe with broad candidates, then tier peers and document inclusion/exclusion rationale.
4. Source market data and financials using the source hierarchy.
5. Normalize data and document every adjustment.
6. Calculate equity value, enterprise value, and multiples.
7. Build peer statistics, outlier treatment, valuation range, and sensitivities.
8. Add an MD/PM-grade first-tab summary with clear judgment, risks, and unresolved questions.
9. Run QA, document issues, and preserve formulas.

### Extend or repair an existing model

1. Inspect tabs, formulas, named ranges, source tables, date stamps, outputs, hidden sheets, and external links before changing anything.
2. Map the existing workbook against the recommended tab architecture. Preserve a functioning structure rather than rebuilding reflexively.
3. Add missing pieces: source log, peer rationale, normalized data, benchmarking, sensitivity, or QA log.
4. Identify stale data, hardcoded formulas, inconsistent denominators, missing adjustments, unsupported conclusions, and formula drift across peer rows.
5. Upgrade the output narrative from descriptive to decision-oriented.
6. Run the audit script when possible and document any manual checks or unresolved warnings.

## Output discipline

When using `scripts/create_comps_template.py`, write generated files to a user- or task-specific `--output-dir` outside the skill package. Treat the `.xlsx` workbook as the human deliverable. Treat `manifest.json` as an agent-facing support file that records where the workbook was written, the target/ticker/date inputs, and the distinction between deliverable and support artifacts.

Follow `../../../../plugin-support/references/workbook-first-tab-standard.md`: the first visible tab should be a banker-readable `Executive Summary`, `Cover`, or `Dashboard`, not a README-only instruction sheet.

## Recommended tabs

### Executive Summary

Include:

- Transaction/company and as-of date.
- Decision question or mandate.
- Recommendation/readiness/status.
- Peer set, relevant multiples, selected median/range, excluded names, and distorted denominators.
- Valuation implication and top sensitivities.
- Source/caveat status.
- Key risks and open diligence.
- Next steps.
- Model map.

### Control

Minimum fields:

- Target company/ticker.
- Valuation date.
- Reporting currency.
- Output currency.
- FX source/date if applicable.
- Fiscal year-end.
- LTM period definition.
- Forward estimate periods.
- Source priority.
- Scenario selection.
- QA status.

### Universe

Recommended columns:

- Ticker.
- Company name.
- Exchange/country.
- Peer tier: Target, Core, Secondary, Adjacent, Watchlist, Excluded.
- Business description.
- Segment/revenue mix.
- Geography.
- Customer/end-market mix.
- Size relevance.
- Growth relevance.
- Margin relevance.
- Inclusion rationale.
- Exclusion rationale.
- Analyst notes.

### Market_Data

Recommended columns:

- Ticker.
- Price.
- Valuation date.
- Basic shares.
- Diluted shares.
- Options/RSUs/converts adjustment.
- Market capitalization.
- Total debt.
- Lease debt treatment.
- Preferred stock.
- Minority interest.
- Cash and short-term investments.
- Enterprise value.
- Source.
- Source confidence.

Enterprise value bridge:

`Equity Value = Share Price * Diluted Shares`

`Enterprise Value = Equity Value + Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest + Other Claims - Cash and Cash Equivalents - Non-operating Investments`

Adapt for sector-specific conventions. For banks and insurers, avoid standard EV metrics unless specifically justified.

### Financials

Recommended columns by period:

- Revenue.
- Gross profit.
- EBITDA.
- EBIT.
- Net income.
- EPS.
- Operating cash flow.
- Capital expenditure.
- Free cash flow.
- Sector KPIs.
- Source and definition.

Keep reported, adjusted, and normalized figures in separate rows or columns. Do not blend them silently.

### Adjustments

Include:

- Calendarization adjustments.
- FX translation.
- Non-recurring items.
- Stock-based compensation treatment.
- M&A/pro forma adjustments.
- Discontinued operations.
- Lease accounting adjustments.
- Segment or carve-out adjustments.
- Consensus definition adjustments.

Every adjustment should include a source, rationale, amount, period, and whether it affects all peers or only one company.

### Multiples

Recommended outputs:

- EV / Revenue: LTM, CY0, CY1, CY2.
- EV / EBITDA: LTM, CY0, CY1, CY2.
- EV / EBIT: LTM, CY0, CY1, CY2.
- P / E: LTM, CY0, CY1, CY2.
- FCF yield or P / FCF.
- Sector-specific metrics.
- Peer statistics: median, mean, harmonic mean where useful, 25th/75th percentile, min/max, core-peer median.
- Flags for negative, zero, not meaningful, or outlier denominators.

Do not calculate a misleading multiple when the denominator is negative, near zero, not comparable, or not meaningful. Use `NM` and explain.

### Benchmarking

Recommended categories:

- Size: revenue, market cap, EV.
- Growth: revenue CAGR, EBITDA CAGR, KPI growth.
- Profitability: gross margin, EBITDA margin, EBIT margin, FCF margin, ROIC.
- Capital intensity: capex/revenue, working capital, leverage.
- Quality: recurring revenue, retention, pricing power, customer concentration, cyclicality, regulation, asset intensity.
- Valuation premium/discount rationale.

### Valuation

Include:

- Selected peer set and selected multiple range.
- Target metric used for valuation.
- Implied enterprise value.
- Net debt and other claims.
- Implied equity value.
- Diluted shares.
- Implied value per share.
- Scenario outputs.
- Conclusion narrative.

### Sensitivity

Include at least one two-way sensitivity table:

- Selected multiple range vs target financial metric.
- Selected multiple range vs net debt or diluted share count.
- Growth/margin scenario vs selected multiple where appropriate.

### Sources

Each key source should include:

- Company/ticker.
- Metric.
- Period.
- Source name.
- Document or connector path.
- URL/accession if applicable.

- Confidence level.
- Notes.

### QA_Log

Include:

- Check name.
- Status: Pass, Fail, Warning, Not run.
- Finding.
- Fix/action.
- Owner or next step.
- Date completed.

## Excel formula rules

- Use formulas for calculated fields whenever possible.
- Keep assumption cells separate and clearly marked.
- Use `IFERROR` sparingly; do not hide real issues. Prefer explicit denominator checks.
- Use `NM` or blank with flags for not-meaningful multiples.
- For peer statistics, calculate both all-peer and core-peer statistics.
- Use consistent rows and columns across tabs to allow formula copy-down.
- Avoid volatile formulas unless necessary.
- Avoid external links in final deliverables unless explicitly requested.

## Formatting conventions

Use a consistent convention, adapted to the user's template if one exists:

- Inputs: clearly shaded or marked.
- Formulas: standard model style.
- Linked cells: visually distinct from local formulas.
- Outputs: clearly highlighted and easy to find.
- Hardcodes in output tabs: avoided unless labeled as assumptions.
- Negative values and `NM`: visible and not hidden by formatting.

## Formula QA checks

Check for:

- Broken formulas: `#REF!`, `#VALUE!`, `#DIV/0!`, `#N/A`.
- Inconsistent formulas across peer rows.
- Hidden hardcodes in formulas or output ranges.
- Circular references.
- External links.
- Wrong signs for cash, debt, minority interest, and non-operating assets.
- Currency/unit mismatches.
- LTM and NTM mismatches.
- Outliers included without rationale.
