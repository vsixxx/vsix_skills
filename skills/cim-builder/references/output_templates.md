# Output Templates

## Initial response template

Use when starting a CIM build or refresh.

```markdown
# CIM build / refresh plan for [company/project]

## 1. Transaction context
- transaction type:
- seller type:
- buyer universe:
- process objective:
- confidentiality level:
- key assumptions:

## 2. Input completeness
| area | status | confidence | notes / gaps |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| company overview |  |  |  |
| financials |  |  |  |
| KPIs |  |  |  |
| customers |  |  |  |
| market |  |  |  |
| forecast |  |  |  |
| management interviews |  |  |  |

## 3. Equity story spine
[concise narrative]

## 4. Recommended outputs
[what can be drafted now vs what requires more data]

## 5. Immediate data asks
[prioritized list]
```

## Standalone HTML CIM or storyboard

Use this structure when a written CIM, teaser, or CIM storyboard is requested or when format is not otherwise resolved. Follow `../../plugin-support/references/html-artifact-standard.md`; the result is a polished document owned by `cim-builder`, not a `dashboard-builder` package.

Recommended first-read sequence:

1. Cover, circulation posture, transaction context, and as-of date.
2. Executive story or proposed buyer narrative with clear evidence posture.
3. Transaction perimeter, process status, and any marketing constraint that affects use of the draft.
4. Investment highlights or storyboard rationale.
5. Proposed page flow and key exhibit plan.
6. Supported operating, financial, valuation, or transaction facts relevant to the story.
7. Buyer diligence pressure points and credible framing.
8. Management, counsel, and QC support required before circulation.
9. Source register and readiness conclusion.

Design and content rules:

- Use a document-style hierarchy, restrained color, readable tables, and decision-useful callouts rather than dashboard cards or operational control bars.
- Keep external draft language distinct from internal drafting notes and circulation blockers.
- In a public-source storyboard, label public facts, analytical hypotheses, and unavailable management proof plainly.
- Cite material facts close to their use and retain a concise source register.
- Do not expose render contracts, local implementation paths, manifests, support JSON, or generic `Open report` / `Model file` controls.
- Render and visually inspect the opening view and at least one downstream evidence or readiness section through local headless-browser screenshots before delivery.

5. Financial proof: [metrics and source]

Prioritize by impact on launch readiness.

```markdown
## Priority 1 - blocks external-ready CIM

## Priority 2 - improves valuation or buyer confidence
- [data / confirmation needed]

## Priority 3 - nice to have / appendix support
- [data / confirmation needed]
```

```

## External-ready vs internal banker notes

Always separate these sections:

```markdown
## External-ready language
[language suitable for CIM draft subject to firm/client review]

## Banker-internal notes
[candid diligence risks, process concerns, and recommended follow-up]

## Counsel / compliance review flags
[items requiring review before distribution]
```
