# Shot Explorer

Use this skill when the user has a visual anchor and wants to choose which shot directions to generate: alternate angles, crop/pan options, zooms, macro details, and one useful surprise angle.

Read `plugin-support/references/experience-contract.md` before writing the user-facing handoff or reporting artifact links.

Read `plugin-support/references/artifact-contracts.md` before creating, repairing, or reporting artifacts.

Read `plugin-support/references/codex-exec-image-generation.md` before running image generation.

Read `plugin-support/references/image-building-strategy.md` alongside the Codex exec contract for first-pass imagery rules.

## Pipeline Role


Use it after there is a visual anchor to preserve:

- a product, packaging, object, apparel, venue, UI, character, or scene reference;
- a selected generated image that needs camera-angle exploration;

It does not produce final publish-bound ad layouts, deterministic product labels, legal copy, or brand-safe final crops. If the user needs a first broad visual territory, use `moodboard-explorer` or `offer-explorer` first. Use the mood-board Remix controls after rendered shot outputs when the user wants controlled versions.

## Anchor And Scope

Preserve the source image's subject identity:

- silhouette, proportions, colors, visible materials, logos, packaging shape, and important surface details;
- category and business context;
- approved copy or markings already present in the source;
- channel constraints, if supplied.

Vary only camera and composition dimensions:

- angle: overhead, side profile, three-quarter, low hero, back;
- crop/pan: pan left/right, zoom in, wider context;
- detail: macro texture, material edge, surface texture;
- surprise: one commercially useful unexpected angle.

Do not introduce unsupported claims, fake endorsements, new brand names, competitor marks, or new readable text unless the user explicitly asks for that.

## Core Pattern

Shot Explorer should use the same interaction shape as the other Creative Production explorers:

Shot Explorer is not a default 25-pack. It generates only the shot directions the user selects in the intake picker or asks for explicitly.

1. Capture or confirm the source image.
2. Render a compact intake widget so the user can tick the shot directions they want.
3. Stop and wait for the widget selection or follow-up.
4. Generate only the selected shot directions as a batch.
5. Display the results through the same shared Creative Production `image-wall` review HTML and contact sheet used by the other explorers, not a bespoke Shot Explorer control app or special Shot-only review preset.
6. End with shot metadata and a handoff to the next stage.

The first user-visible surface is the intake picker, and the main review surface is the shared renderer used by the other explorers. Do not create a separate dark upload/control/feed UI for ordinary Shot Explorer runs.

## Workflow

1. Capture the source.
   - If the user provides an image in chat or a file path, use it as `--base-asset`.
   - If no source is available, ask for the image before continuing; shot exploration depends on reference-image preservation.
   - State what must survive in every shot: subject shape, color, materials, logo/text treatment, and category.

2. Run the intake gate.
   - When MCP widgets are available, render `render_shot_intake_widget` with three compact groups: angles, crops, and details.
   - Include any obvious source context in the widget title or summary, but keep the widget itself to tickable shot directions.
   - After rendering the intake widget, stop and wait for the selection or widget follow-up. Do not create prompts, generate images, or render review HTML in the same step.
   - When the request is already a widget follow-up such as "Continue with this qualified shot intake and create the shots," treat intake as complete and proceed.
   - If MCP widgets are unavailable, ask the same shot-direction choices in chat and wait for the answer.

3. Build the selected shot batch.
   - Use the bundled script:

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/create_shot_explorer.py \
  --base-asset "<path-to-image>" \
  --output <output-dir> \
  --selected overhead \
  --selected side-profile \
  --selected macro-detail \
  --force
```

   - Choose an output directory under a stable workspace path such as `outputs/shot-explorer/<brief-slug>/`, unless the user provides a durable destination.
   - The script writes `data/shot-spec.json`, `data/prompts-manifest.json`, `data/jobs.jsonl`, `data/selected-shot-route.json`, `data/handoff.md`, `review-board.html`, `moodboard-widget-payload.json`, and a contact sheet when images exist.
   - If generation is not approved, save the prompt manifest and handoff metadata so the run can resume later. Do not present prompt cards as the main user-facing review result.

4. Generate shots when approval is available.
   - Before high-volume generation, state the planned shot count and review surface.
   - Default to Fast mode for exploration. Use Pro mode only for selected directions or when preservation quality matters.
   - Source-image metadata is included in worker context, but generation is prompt-driven through native image generation; keep that caveat in handoff metadata.
   - Run selected generation with:

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/create_shot_explorer.py \
  --base-asset "<path-to-image>" \
  --output <output-dir> \
  --selected overhead \
  --selected side-profile \
  --selected macro-detail \
  --mode fast \
  --generate \
  --force
```

5. Review and export the handoff.
   - Open `review-board.html` or show it in the local/in-app browser only for agent-side verification or explicit debug requests.
   - Use the shared review page and contact sheet for inspection; do not launch a separate Shot Explorer server UI.
   - When an inline MCP review surface is available, pass `moodboard-widget-payload.json` to `render_moodboard_board_widget`. Keep the shot intake widget for pre-generation selection only.
   - The review wall should use the shared `layout: "wall"` / `image-wall` renderer and show generated images only. Prompt text belongs in `data/prompts-manifest.json`, not on the board.
   - If generated images are missing, leave the review page as the shared pending state and point to the manifest for resumable generation. Do not use prompt cards as a visible substitute for images.
   - Identify the strongest shot direction in the handoff once the user chooses one.
   - Keep rejected directions out of the next stage when the user has explicitly rejected them.

## Shared Review Output

Use the shared static review renderer, via `scripts/review_renderer.py` through the Shot Explorer script. Do not hand-write custom review HTML for this skill.

Review output should be:

- white-background, image-first, and consistent with other Creative Production review boards;
- one generated shot per tile;
- captions suppressed by default, following Ads Explorer's image-wall behavior;
- no Shot-specific review controls, side panels, prompt cards, or custom preset; use the same static image-wall HTML contract as Ads/Offer Explorer;
- prompt and generation details stored in metadata, not dominant on the first screen;
- durable under the run output folder, not only a transient localhost URL.

## Handoff Shape

Use the same lightweight handoff wording as the other explorers: selected direction, preserve, avoid, focused next owner, and artifact path.

For shot exploration runs, preserve:

- source image metadata and source hash;
- selected shot IDs, labels, groups, prompts, and generated image paths;
- rejected directions when the user has ruled them out;
- constraints to preserve and avoid;
- mode, model, quality, size, and generation caveats;

## Exit Criteria

A successful shot exploration ends with:

- completed intake or an explicit decision to skip intake;
- generated or prompt-only shot options for the selected directions;
- a shared `review-board.html` gallery and contact sheet when images exist;
- reusable prompt metadata and source preservation constraints;
- a named next step for controlled remixing or production polish;
- caveats about generated text, logo fidelity, inferred reverse angles, product accuracy, and unsupported visual assumptions.

- `scripts/create_shot_explorer.py`: validates the spec, copies an optional base asset, generates selected image-edit shots when approved, and renders the shared review page.
