description: Explore business, service, customer, retail, and point-of-sale scenes that place a product, venue, service, or offer inside realistic commercial contexts. Use when the user wants scene prompts, product-in-environment exploration, service moments, consumer decision contexts, or reusable scene libraries before mood, style, asset, or polish work.

# Scene Explorer

Use this skill when the user wants to explore where a product, service, venue, or offer should appear in the real world.

This is the Explore-stage owner for commercial scenes: point of sale, customer decision moments, service environments, retail displays, showroom settings, customer handoffs, demo spaces, and business contexts.

Read `plugin-support/references/experience-contract.md` before writing the user-facing handoff.

Read `plugin-support/references/artifact-contracts.md` before creating, repairing, or reporting artifacts.

Read `plugin-support/references/codex-exec-image-generation.md` before running image generation.

Read `plugin-support/references/image-building-strategy.md` alongside the Codex exec contract for first-pass imagery rules.

## Pipeline Role

Use `scene-explorer` after the user has a subject anchor or a business category and wants to see that subject in relevant environments.

Use `moodboard-explorer` when the question is broad mood, taste, audience feeling, or creative territory.

Use `offer-explorer` when the question is offer-family coverage across the general prompt library.


Use builders or polish skills after a scene is selected:

- Use the mood-board app's Remix controls when rendered scene outputs should become controlled versions by character, style, camera, format, palette, props, or product placement.
- `generative-polish` for publish-bound marketing image finish.

## Scene Definition

Each scene family should define:

- `sceneArchetype`: the reusable commercial moment, such as boutique try-on, consultation counter, demo island, pickup shelf, or trade-show booth.
- `placeholders`: variable inputs the scene can accept, such as `{subject}`, `{market_context}`, `{customer_type}`, `{tone}`, `{interaction}`, `{supporting_objects}`, `{brand_surface}`, and `{channel_use}`.
- `summary`: what business moment it represents.
- `businessGoal`: why a business would use it.
- `scene`: the visual environment.
- `sceneShape`: the compositional shape, such as counter, wall, table, aisle, booth, consultation desk, demo island, or handoff bay.
- `subjectPlacement`: where the supplied product, service asset, or offer should appear.
- `subjectSlot`: a machine-readable placement contract with slot type, placement, scale, interaction, service fallback, digital fallback, and what to preserve.
- `focus`: what the viewer should understand.
- `decision`: what business decision the scene helps make.
- `elements`: key visible parts.
- `constraints`: facts and safety rails.
- `avoid`: common failure modes.

The scene should be specific enough to produce an image, but generic enough to reuse across brands and future product images. Prefer slot language over hard-coded places or props unless the user has supplied those details.

## Default Pack

Use the checked-in `plugin-support/assets/scene-library/packs/business-point-of-sale-scenes.json` for broad cross-industry scene exploration.

The pack contains 25 reusable starter scene families across retail, hospitality, services, healthcare, finance, mobility, events, ecommerce, and field sales. The number describes starter directions in the pack, not a required mood-board tile count.

## Workflow

1. Capture the subject anchor.
   - Product image, product description, service brief, venue brief, offer, campaign, or brand moment.
   - Preserve exact product appearance, claims, logo rules, menu facts, regulated claims, channel requirements, and known context.

2. Select scenes.
   - For broad exploration, use the 25-scene pack.
   - For narrow use, choose 5-8 scenes that fit the category and business goal.
   - Avoid near-duplicates. The value is environmental diversity.

3. Build prompts.
   - Use the offer explorer script as the shared prompt-pack engine:

```bash
python3 skills/offer-explorer/scripts/build_offer_explorer.py \
  --offer-name "<subject name>" \
  --subject-kind product \
  --offer-brief "<facts to preserve>" \
  --expansion-map assets/scene-library/packs/business-point-of-sale-scenes.json \
  --pack business-point-of-sale-scenes \
  --scale family \
  --out-dir outputs/imagegen/<subject-slug>-business-pos-scenes
```

Use `--subject-kind venue`, `--subject-kind service`, or `--subject-kind experience` when the subject is not a physical product.

4. Generate images only when requested.
   - Generating one image for every starter scene family can be expensive. Confirm before generating all images.
   - No-image prompt manifests are useful for review and prioritization.
   - When generated scene images exist and an inline MCP review surface is available, render the scene set with `render_moodboard_board_widget`.

5. Handoff.
   - Name the strongest scenes.
   - Explain which scene supports which business use: display, trial, demo, booking, consultation, checkout, event, loyalty, or handoff.
   - Use the same lightweight handoff wording as the other explorers: selected direction, preserve, avoid, focused next owner, and artifact path.

## Exit Criteria

A successful scene exploration ends with:

- reusable scene prompts or generated scene options;
- subject facts preserved;
- 5-25 distinct customer/business environment directions, with generated images only for the scenes selected or requested;
- clear business use for each scene;
- selected scene directions and next production owner.
