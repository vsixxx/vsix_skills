# Login Flow

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

A skill for generating mobile-first login and authentication screens. Use this when the user wants a sign-in experience for a mobile app, including phone + SMS verification, password-based login, and social SSO options.

## Workflow

1. **Read reference files first** (see below)
2. **Clarify auth method**: phone/SMS, password, or social SSO
3. **Checklist gate** — verify P0 items before emitting `<artifact>`
4. **Build the HTML prototype** with proper states (default, loading, error)
5. **Wrap in `<artifact>` tag** referencing the output file

## Side Files

- `references/checklist.md` — P0/P1 acceptance criteria

## Output

A single standalone HTML file implementing the login screen with:
- Labels above inputs (never placeholder-only)
- Password field with show/hide toggle
- Social SSO buttons with SVG icons
- Error states below fields
- Loading spinner in primary CTA
- Touch targets minimum 44px

## Mobile-First Constraints

- Viewport: 375px wide (iPhone standard)
- No horizontal scroll
- Safe area insets for notched devices
- Input keyboards: `tel` for phone, `password` for password fields
