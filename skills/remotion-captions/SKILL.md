# Remotion Captions

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

All captions must be processed in JSON. The captions must use the [`Caption`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/captions/caption.md) type which is the following:

```ts
import type { Caption } from "@remotion/captions";
```

This is the definition:

```ts
type Caption = {
  text: string;
  startMs: number;
  endMs: number;
  timestampMs: number | null;
  confidence: number | null;
};
```
