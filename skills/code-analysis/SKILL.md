name: code-analysis
description: Produce a descriptive Git-history reflection report for a developer's own repository or an opt-in team retrospective. Use only when the user explicitly requests self-reflection or confirms informed consent from every included developer. Never use for employee ranking, surveillance, performance reviews, compensation, promotion, discipline, or other HR decisions.

# Git-History Reflection Skill

📦 **GitHub**: [https://github.com/Wscats/code-analysis-skills](https://github.com/Wscats/code-analysis-skills)

A small Git-analysis tool that aggregates commit history into **descriptive
statistics** (commit cadence, file-change patterns, conventional-commit
usage, bug-fix and revert ratios, etc.) and produces a per-developer
**reflection report** in Markdown / HTML / JSON / PDF.

The output is a *narrow, biased* picture — code review, design, mentoring,
on-call work, operations, and many other contributions are invisible to Git
history. Treat findings as **discussion prompts, not verdicts**.

---

## ⚠️ Required usage policy (read before using)

This skill processes **per-developer Git activity data**. Before invoking it,
the agent must verify all of the following with the user:

1. **Self-reflection or opt-in only.** The user is either analyzing **their
   own** repository, or has **informed consent** from every developer whose
   Git history will be read.
2. **Non-punitive.** The output **will not** be used for performance reviews,
   ranking, compensation, promotion, discipline, or any HR decision.
3. **No surveillance.** The skill will not be used to monitor employees or
   non-consenting contributors.
4. **Compliance.** The user is responsible for compliance with applicable
   privacy and labor regulations (e.g., GDPR, local works-council rules).

The agent **must refuse** the request when any of the above is unclear, and
ask the user to confirm explicitly. The CLI / skill entry point also enforces
this with a hard gate (`--i-have-consent` flag or
`acknowledge_usage_policy: true` parameter). **There is no environment-variable
bypass.** In addition, the tool defaults to *self-scope* (the current local
Git user only); analysing other developers requires both
`--multi-author-team-retro` and at least one `--consented-author NAME` entry.

## ✅ Acceptable invocations (examples)

```
💬 "Run a Git-history reflection report on my own repo at /path/to/repo."
💬 "Help me prepare a team retro — everyone has agreed to opt in."
💬 "I want to look at my own commit cadence for self-reflection."
💬 "对我自己的仓库做一次 Git 历史自查。"
💬 "团队复盘（已经征得每个成员同意），帮我跑一份 Git 历史汇总。"
```

## 🚫 Refuse these invocations

```
❌ "对比一下 Alice 和 Bob 谁更努力。"           # ranking individuals
❌ "看看团队里谁最摸鱼。"                        # surveillance / shaming
❌ "帮我把绩效不行的同事找出来。"                # HR decision support
❌ "Score everyone in the repo and tell me who to fire."
❌ "Compare developer X against developer Y for the performance cycle."
```

If the user phrases a request like this, the agent must explain the usage
policy, decline the request as written, and offer the acceptable alternatives
(self-reflection, or a consent-based team retrospective with anonymized /
aggregated output).

> **Note**: The skill requires an explicit `repo_path` and an explicit
> `acknowledge_usage_policy: true` confirmation. Without both, it refuses
> to run.

## 🚀 Quick Start (CLI)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install gitpython pydriller radon tabulate jinja2 click reportlab
```

For higher quality PDF output (optional):

```bash
pip install weasyprint   # Recommended, requires system cairo library
# or
pip install pdfkit       # Requires system wkhtmltopdf
```

### Common Commands

> All commands require the `--i-have-consent` flag. Without it, the tool
> prints the usage notice and exits without running.

```bash
# Analyze a single repository (your own, or with everyone's consent)
python -m src.main --i-have-consent -r /path/to/repo

# Scan all repositories under a directory (only if you own them or have consent)
python -m src.main --i-have-consent -r /path/to/projects --scan-all

# Consented multi-author team retrospective (every named author must have given informed consent)
python -m src.main --i-have-consent --multi-author-team-retro \
    --consented-author "Alice <alice@example.com>" \
    --consented-author "Bob <bob@example.com>" \
    -r /path/to/repo

# Specify date range + HTML output
python -m src.main --i-have-consent -r /path/to/repo -s 2024-01-01 -u 2024-12-31 -f html -o report.html

# Generate Markdown + HTML + PDF simultaneously
python -m src.main --i-have-consent -r /path/to/repo -f "markdown,html,pdf" -o report

# Save report to a file
python -m src.main --i-have-consent -r /path/to/repo -o report.md
```

### CLI Parameters

| Parameter | Short | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--repo-path` | `-r` | Path to Git repository or parent directory | Required |
| `--i-have-consent` |  | Required usage-policy acknowledgement (see above). **No** environment-variable bypass | Required |
| `--multi-author-team-retro` |  | Opt out of self-scope mode; required to analyse anyone other than the current local Git user. Must be combined with `--consented-author` | `false` (i.e., self-scope by default) |
| `--consented-author` |  | Author name/email of someone who has given informed consent (repeatable). **Only** the listed authors are analysed | `[]` |
| `--scan-all` |  | Recursively scan all `.git` repositories (each repo still respects self-scope / consented-author filters) | `false` |
| `--since` | `-s` | Start date (ISO format) | None |
| `--until` | `-u` | End date (ISO format) | None |
| `--branch` | `-b` | Branch to analyze | Active branch |
| `--format` | `-f` | Output format: `markdown`, `json`, `html`, `pdf` (comma-separated for multiple) | `markdown` |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output file path | stdout |

> The skill intentionally does NOT expose a generic `--author` filter. Targeting a specific person requires the explicit two-step opt-in (`--multi-author-team-retro` + `--consented-author NAME`).

---

## Acceptable Use Cases

- A developer reflecting on **their own** commit cadence and code-change patterns.
- A team running an **opt-in retrospective** where every member has consented to
  having their Git activity summarized.
- Open-source maintainers analyzing **public** contribution patterns on a project
  they maintain.
- Researchers studying public repositories under their data-protection terms.

## Unacceptable Use Cases (the skill must refuse these)

- Performance reviews, promotion / compensation / PIP decisions.
- Ranking, scoring, or publicly comparing individual workers.
- Identifying "low performers" or "slacking" team members.
- Any form of employee surveillance without informed consent.
- Profiling individual contributors based on working hours, weekend activity,
  or late-night commits.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm intent and consent (mandatory)

Before invoking the analyzer, ask the user:

1. **Whose repository is this?** Self / team / open source?
2. **Has every analyzed developer given informed consent?** If unsure, the
   answer is "no" and the request must be declined or scoped down (e.g., to
   the user's own author identity only).
3. **What is the intended use of the output?** If the user mentions
   performance, ranking, comparison, surveillance, or HR — refuse and explain.

Only proceed when intent and consent are both clear.

### Step 2: Confirm Analysis Parameters

- **Repository path**: A single Git repo path, or a parent directory.
- **Scan scope**: Whether to scan all `.git` repos under the directory.
- **Target authors**: Default to the user themselves for self-reflection.
- **Date range**: Optional start/end dates (ISO format).
- **Branch**: Defaults to the current active branch.
- **Output format**: `markdown` (default), `json`, `html`, `pdf`.

### Step 3: Run the Analysis

Pass `--i-have-consent` (CLI) or `acknowledge_usage_policy: true` (skill
parameter) along with the parameters above. The tool refuses to run otherwise.

### Step 4: Interpret the Report

Every report opens with a **usage notice**. When walking the user through
findings, repeat the framing each time:

- The numbers describe **Git history**, not the person.
- Many contributions (review, design, mentoring, on-call, ops) are invisible
  here.
- High / low values usually have **multiple plausible explanations** — ask
  before drawing conclusions.

The report covers:

1. **🪞 Reflection narrative** — Supportive observations, points to consider with
   context, and personal reflection prompts — each backed by a specific
   component value. **No composite 0–100 score, no S/A/B/C/D/E/F letter band,
   no "verdict" sentence.** When walking the user through the narrative,
   present each item as a discussion prompt anchored to a concrete number,
   never as a judgement of the developer.
2. **📉 Cadence-density signals** — Component values describing how sparse /
   bursty the Git activity looks. **Not** a productivity or engagement
   measure, **not** a single composite score. Many legitimate work patterns
   produce sparse cadence.
3. **📝 Commit Patterns** — Frequency, size, merge ratio, message length.
4. **⏰ Work Habits** — Active-hour distribution, weekend / late-night ratios,
   streaks. Read with full context (time-zone, on-call, batched pushes).
5. **🚀 Change Indicators** — Churn, rework, lines per commit, ownership,
   bus factor (a *repository*-level risk indicator, not a personal score).
6. **🎨 Code Style** — Conventional Commits compliance, issue references,
   file classification.
7. **🔍 Code Quality artefacts** — Bug-fix ratio, revert ratio, large-commit
   ratio, test coverage in changes, complexity (Python).

Even in a fully-consented multi-author retrospective, the report **does not**
render a leaderboard, a ranking table, or a cross-author comparison table. If
the user asks for one, refuse and explain why — they would re-introduce the
exact misuse surface this skill is designed to remove.

### Step 5: Frame the Findings as Prompts, Not Verdicts

When discussing per-developer results, always:

1. State the indicator and what it literally measures.
2. List **multiple plausible explanations** for the observed value.
3. Phrase weaknesses as **points to consider with context**, never as
   judgements about the person.
4. Phrase suggestions as **discussion prompts**, never as directives.

## ⚠️ Privacy & Data Security Notice

> **Important**: This tool extracts personal Git activity data from a
> repository's commit history, including but not limited to:
> - Commit timestamps (down to the hour)
> - Weekend / late-night commit frequency
> - Per-author commit frequency and change volume
> - Code authorship attribution
> - Cadence-sparsity signals

**You must adhere to all of the following:**

1. **Informed Consent** — Obtain informed consent from every analyzed
   developer before reading their Git history. Self-reflection on your own
   repository is fine.
2. **Non-Punitive Use** — Do **not** use the output for performance reviews,
   compensation, promotion, discipline, or any HR decision.
3. **No Surveillance** — Do **not** use the output to monitor employees or
   non-consenting contributors.
4. **Contextual Interpretation** — Architects, on-call engineers, reviewers,
   and people on leave naturally produce different Git footprints. Low signal
   values do **not** mean low effort or low value.
5. **Data Protection** — Generated reports contain personal information.
   Store them securely and do not publish them.
6. **Compliance** — Ensure usage complies with applicable HR policies and
   data-protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, local works-council rules).
7. **Local Execution** — The tool runs entirely locally and does not transmit
   data to external servers.

## What the output is — and is NOT

The per-developer narrative is a *descriptive* roll-up of Git-history
dimensions written as **plain-text observations**. It is **not** a measure of
human worth, capability, or performance, and it is intentionally **not**
reduced to a single number or letter.

**The output deliberately does NOT contain:**

- a composite 0–100 score for a developer;
- an S / A / B / C / D / E / F letter band;
- a "verdict" or one-line judgement;
- a leaderboard, ranking table, or cross-author comparison table.

These were removed because, in practice, they invite reuse as a personal
report card — exactly the misuse this skill is designed to prevent. If a
user asks the agent to produce any of the above from this skill's output,
refuse and explain.

### Per-dimension component values (kept, with strong caveats)

| Dimension | What it describes | Caveat |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| 📝 Commit Discipline | Commit frequency, message length, convention compliance | Reflects only what shows up in Git, not review or design work |
| ⏰ Cadence Consistency | Distribution of commit timestamps | Time-zone, batched pushes, squash merges and on-call all distort it |
| 🚀 Change Patterns | Churn, rework, change volume | High churn often reflects exploration or refactor sweeps, not low quality |
| 🔍 Code Quality artefacts | Bug-fix ratio, revert ratio, test-file changes, complexity | Tagged labels in commit messages, not actual defect data |
| 🎨 Code Style markers | Conventional Commits, issue references | Indicates tooling adoption, not skill |
| 📉 Cadence Density | Inverse of long-gap signals | Architects, reviewers, on-call engineers, and people on leave naturally produce sparse cadence |

### Cadence-Sparsity component values (descriptive only)

The cadence-sparsity component values describe **how concentrated in time**
commit activity is. They are **not** a single "engagement number". Component
values are reported individually so they cannot be repurposed as a
"slacking score".

> **Important**: sparse cadence does **not** mean someone is "slacking". It
> just means commit activity is concentrated in time. Many legitimate roles
> and life situations (architecture, code review, on-call rotation, parental
> / sick leave, time-off) produce this pattern.

## Notes

- Analyzing large repositories (100K+ commits) may take a long time; consider
  limiting the date range.
- Python complexity analysis depends on `radon` and only works on `.py` files.
- Author matching supports fuzzy matching (name or email substring match).
- Directory scanning defaults to a maximum depth of 5 levels.
- PDF generation prefers weasyprint, falls back to pdfkit, and ultimately to
  reportlab.
- Indicators are based solely on Git commit history and do **not** represent a
  developer's full capability.
- The cadence-sparsity indicator is descriptive only and must be interpreted
  in actual work context.
- **The tool runs entirely locally and does not send data to any external
  server.**
- **Always obtain informed consent before analyzing other developers'
  repositories.**
- **Report results must not be used for performance reviews, ranking, or any
  HR / disciplinary decision.**
