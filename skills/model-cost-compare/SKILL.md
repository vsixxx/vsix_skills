name: model-cost-compare
description: Trigger when the user asks which model to use, wants to compare model costs, says "what's cheapest for this task", "should I use Opus or Sonnet", "can a smaller model handle this", or "/model-cost-compare". Estimates token cost across Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, GLM-5.1, Minimax M2.7, and local Gemma 4, then recommends the cheapest model capable of the task. Use when Codex needs to perform Model Cost Compare tasks, or when the user explicitly mentions model-cost-compare.

# Model Cost Compare

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

Given a task description (and optionally a rough prompt / input size), estimate the cost of running it on each available model tier and recommend the cheapest one that can actually do the job.

## When to use

- "Which model should I use for X?"
- "Is it worth running this on Opus or will Sonnet do?"
- "Can I offload this to a local model?"
- "/model-cost-compare — classify 10k support tickets"

## Pricing table (indicative — always flag as "check provider docs")

Use these rough figures. They are **not** exact; confirm before quoting real numbers to the user.

| Model | Tier | Input ($/1M tok) | Output ($/1M tok) | Context | Strengths |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opus 4.6 (1M) | Frontier | ~$15 | ~$75 | 1M | Agentic, long-context, hard reasoning |
| Sonnet 4.6 | Mid | ~$3 | ~$15 | 400k | Everyday coding, agents, drafting |
| GLM-5.1 | Budget hosted | ~$0.60 | ~$2.20 | 256k | Cheap bulk work, decent reasoning |
| Minimax M2.7 | Budget hosted | ~$0.40 | ~$1.80 | 256k | Very cheap, OK for templated output |
| Gemma 4 (local) | On device | $0 marginal | $0 marginal | 32k | Free but slow, weak at multi-step logic |

> Indicative pricing as of OpenClaw 2026.4.11. Check the provider docs before billing decisions.

## Instructions

1. Parse the user's task. Extract:
   - **Task type:** reasoning, extraction, classification, drafting, translation, agentic tool use, long-context synthesis.
   - **Input size estimate:** in tokens. If the user says "10k tickets averaging 500 tokens", that's 5M input tokens. If unknown, ask for a rough size.
   - **Output size estimate:** short label? full essay? JSON record?
   - **Volume:** one-off or batch?
2. Rule out incapable models. Use this capability floor:
   - Agentic multi-tool flows with long reasoning → Opus or Sonnet only.
   - Structured extraction / classification with clear schema → any tier, including Gemma 4 local.
   - Long-context synthesis (>400k tokens) → Opus only.
   - Privacy-sensitive data that cannot leave the machine → Gemma 4 local only.
3. For each surviving model, compute:
   ```
   cost = (input_tokens / 1_000_000) * input_price
        + (output_tokens / 1_000_000) * output_price
   ```
   Multiply by volume. Show your arithmetic so the user can sanity-check.
4. Print the comparison as a Markdown table sorted cheapest first. Bold the recommended row.
5. End with a one-line recommendation: `Recommended: <model> — <1-sentence reason>`.

## Output example

Input: "Classify 10,000 customer support emails into 5 categories. Avg 400 input tokens, 20 output tokens."

```
Total tokens: 4M input, 200k output

| Model       | Input cost | Output cost | Total   | Capable? |
|-------------|-----------:|------------:|--------:|---------:|
| **Gemma 4** |     $0.00  |      $0.00  |  $0.00  |   yes    |
| Minimax M2.7|     $1.60  |      $0.36  |  $1.96  |   yes    |
| GLM-5.1     |     $2.40  |      $0.44  |  $2.84  |   yes    |
| Sonnet 4.6  |    $12.00  |      $3.00  | $15.00  |   yes    |
| Opus 4.6    |    $60.00  |     $15.00  | $75.00  |   overkill |

Recommended: Gemma 4 local — classification with a fixed 5-label schema is trivial for on-device models and costs nothing.
```

## Anti-patterns

- Don't recommend Opus by default "just to be safe". If Sonnet can do it, say so.
- Don't recommend a local model for agentic tool-use loops — they spiral.
- Always flag prices as approximate.

## Example invocations

- `/model-cost-compare classify 10k support tickets into 5 buckets`
- "What's the cheapest model that can draft 200 SEO meta descriptions a day?"
- "Should I use Opus or Sonnet for this 800k-token codebase review?"
