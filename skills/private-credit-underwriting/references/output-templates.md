# Output Templates

Use these templates when producing credit screens, memos, monitoring updates, QA reviews, or data requests. Default to a polished standalone HTML lender underwriting memo for `initial_credit_screen` and `underwriting_memo` work when context supports it; use shorter chat screens only when the user explicitly asks for lightweight early triage, quick go/no-go, or an inline update to an existing package.

## Output Posture Labels

End with one posture label:

- `screening-only`: useful for early decision, not committee-ready.
- `diligence-grade`: supportable with named evidence gaps and conditions.
- `committee-ready-with-caveats`: memo can support committee discussion, subject to listed caveats.
- `not-committee-ready`: material missing data, failed tie-outs, or unresolved conflicts block decision use.
- `decline-recommended`: risks, structure, leverage, liquidity, or evidence gaps make the deal unattractive absent major changes.

## Standard Output Contract

Unless the user asks for another format, use this structure:

1. `Recommendation and posture`
2. `Borrower snapshot`
3. `Sources and evidence base`
4. `Transaction overview`
5. `Earnings base and QoE view`
6. `Credit metrics`
7. `Lender case and downside`
8. `Covenants, liquidity, and debt service`
9. `Collateral, recovery, and sponsor support`
10. `Key risks and mitigants`
11. `Required Before Credit Committee` as one prioritized gating table
12. `Decision summary and source/evidence appendix`

For an explicitly requested quick screen, compress sections 2-10 into a one-page style memo but keep recommendation, evidence base, metrics, risks, and next asks.

For an initial screen or narrative underwriting memo, use one prioritized `Required Before Credit Committee` table and one source/evidence appendix. Do not append a second generic diligence module or a dashboard shell around the memo.

For an `initial_credit_screen`, use a diligence-stage recommendation: `proceed-to-diligence-only`, `pass-on-diligence`, or `decline`. Do not use `proceed-with-conditions` unless the work has advanced to a supportable proposed credit structure.

In reader-facing HTML, describe evidence naturally (`SEC-reported`, `management forecast`, `illustrative assumption`, `analyst calculation`, `not provided`) and keep internal evidence taxonomy codes in the appendix or support artifacts rather than displaying raw code pills throughout the memo.

## Decision summary
[one-paragraph conclusion]
```

For acquisition financing where only target-company public information is available, label any target-only debt-service calculation as an `illustrative standalone cash-interest screening ceiling`. State that no combined-borrower underwriting or hold-size conclusion is supportable without acquirer/parent financials, sources and uses, and committed debt terms. Show a cash-flow downside dimension before presenting the ceiling as decision-useful.

Treat disclosed committed acquisition financing as transaction-execution context only until debt terms and combined-borrower effects are underwritten; it is not a credit attraction or lender protection by itself.

For standalone HTML, prioritize a readable recommendation, key facts, downside, and committee gates over dashboard navigation, export controls, or duplicated module shells. Render and inspect the memo through local headless-browser screenshots before delivery.

## Final Self-Check

- Used available attachments, callable connected routes, user-provided exports, and primary sources before asking for more.
- Labeled source limitations and evidence posture.
- Used diligence-stage recommendation language for an initial screen rather than approval-stage `proceed-with-conditions`.
- Kept raw internal evidence taxonomy out of reader-facing narrative and core tables.
- Did not treat committed transaction financing as a credit strength without underwritten combined-borrower terms.
- Distinguished reported, adjusted, normalized, lender, and covenant EBITDA.
- Did not treat management or seller add-backs as facts without support.
- Included downside and liquidity, not just base-case leverage.
- Tied covenant conclusions to actual definitions or labeled them as proxies.
- Identified first loss / first breach / first liquidity-pressure driver when relevant.
- Gave a recommendation appropriate to the stage: diligence action for an initial screen or proceed / decline / proceed-with-conditions for an underwritten credit view.
- Listed exact next documents or fields required to improve reliability.

## Structured Downstream Handoffs

Use `../../plugin-support/references/handoff-contracts.md` when a credit output feeds adjacent workflows:

- `private_credit_underwriting_to_covenant_package_analyzer`: covenant definitions, ratio definitions, threshold/headroom questions, collateral/guarantee concerns, lender protections, and counsel-review flags.
- `private_credit_underwriting_to_distressed_recovery_waterfall`: watchlist/default trigger, debt stack, liquidity trough, first breakpoint, lien/collateral summary, recovery range, sponsor support, and restructuring alternatives to test.

Keep lender-after-haircut EBITDA, covenant EBITDA proxy, selected EBITDA basis, headroom/proxy headroom, and first-breach/breakpoint as separate fields.
