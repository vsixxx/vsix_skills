## 1) Purpose
CIM teardowns fail when they "sound right" but cannot be traced back to a source. This skill requires **audit-grade evidence pointers** so every material fact can be verified.

**Rule 1:** Do not invent pages, exhibits, URLs, titles, or spans.

**Rule 2:** If you cannot pinpoint a location, write `CITATION_TBD` and add an evidence request to resolve.

**Rule 3:** Primary exports and systems-of-record beat web research.

## 2) What counts as a valid evidence pointer
A valid pointer includes enough information for a human to find it again:
- source type
- CIM file name (or doc ID)
- locator fields
- object reference
- span or row reference
- enough detail for another analyst to resolve it quickly

Allowed pointer strings:
- `CIM <file> | p.<page> | <section_path> | <exhibit_id> | <object> | <span>`
- `WEB | <source_name> | <url> | <title> | <date_accessed> | <span/lines>`
- `CITATION_TBD`

Compatibility note:
- exported CSVs may still use the field name `CIM Citation`; store the full pointer string there even if it is a `WEB | ...` citation.

---

## 3) CIM pointer format

Use:
`CIM <file> | p.<page> | <section_path> | <exhibit_id> | <object> | <span>`

Examples:
- `CIM cim_v3.pdf | p.18 | 3.2 Customers | Ex.7 Retention | Chart 7B | lines 4-7`
- `CIM teaser.pdf | p.3 | Highlights | (no exhibit) | Callout box | chars 120-240`

Rules:
- include the file name or version when multiple drafts exist
- if a metric is defined in one place and shown in another, cite both
- for charts, read the footnotes before accepting the headline
- if a table is image-based, cite the table title and visible totals, then request the export

---

## 4) Web pointer format

Use:
`WEB | <source_name> | <url> | <title> | <date_accessed> | <span/lines>`

Examples:
- `WEB | Texas DOT | https://... | 2024 AADT Map | 2026-03-11 | station 12345 row`
- `WEB | County Assessor | https://... | Parcel Details - APN 123-45 | 2026-03-11 | assessed value section`

Web research rules:
- prefer authoritative domains: government, regulators, county/municipal records, SEC/filings, courts, official operator sites, utility providers, DOT sources
- secondary aggregators are lower confidence and should be corroborated when material
- never let web research override system-of-record exports
- any external fact used in underwriting must carry a `WEB | ...` pointer
- avoid random directories or listicles unless corroborated and clearly marked low confidence

Use web research mainly for:
- trade area basics
- traffic counts
- competition mapping
- property records
- permits and zoning basics
- environmental enforcement and other regulatory checks

## 5) How to cite different CIM objects

### 5.1 Text claims
Cite:
- page
- section heading (or slide title)
- line range

Example:
- Claim: "Revenue grew 55% YoY in FY2025"
- Citation: `CIM cim.pdf | p.12 | 2.3 Investment Highlights | (no exhibit) | bullet list | lines 1-2`

### 5.2 Chart claims
Charts often hide qualifiers in footnotes.
Cite:
- chart title + subtitle
- axis labels
- legend
- any data label used
- footnote line(s)

Example:
- `CIM cim.pdf | p.24 | 4.1 Financials | Ex.10 Revenue Bridge | Chart title + footnote | lines 1-8`

### 5.3 Table claims
Tables are often images in PDFs. If table extraction is uncertain:
- cite table title and visible totals
- request the underlying Excel export as evidence

Example:
- `CIM cim.pdf | p.31 | 4.3 Unit Economics | Table 4C | header + totals | visible cells only`

### 5.4 Footnotes and "definitions" slides
Treat footnotes and definition slides as first-class sources.
If a metric is defined in one place and used elsewhere, cite both:
- the metric definition location
- the metric value location

Example:
- Value citation: `CIM cim.pdf | p.18 | 3.2 Customers | Ex.7 | KPI callout | lines 1-2`
- Definition citation: `CIM cim.pdf | p.44 | Appendix | Metric definitions | NRR definition | lines 10-16`

---

## 6) Confidence scoring for pointer quality

- 5: exact page or URL + section/title + object + line/span reference
- 4: exact page or URL + section/title + object
- 3: page or URL + section/title only
- 2: page only or domain only
- 1: citation unknown (`CITATION_TBD`)

---

## 7) Common failure modes

### Failure: "I think it was on p.18"
Fix: do not guess. Use `CITATION_TBD`, then request:
- the latest CIM PDF
- the exhibit referenced
- or a page screenshot

### Failure: Chart numbers not extractable
Fix:
- cite chart title + visible labels
- request the underlying Excel and rebuild the chart from data

### Failure: Multiple CIM versions
Fix:
- include CIM filename/version in the pointer
- treat changes as a new version; do not reuse old citations

### Failure: Web fact from a weak source
Fix:
- downgrade confidence
- seek corroboration from a primary source
- if material to underwriting, do not rely on it alone
