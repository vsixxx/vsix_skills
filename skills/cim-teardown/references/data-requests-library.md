## 1) Principles
- Specify: system, report name, filters, fields, time window, granularity, format.
- Always request the raw keys (customer_id, contract_id, invoice_id, opp_id) so you can join data.
- Prefer exports with timestamps and historical change logs (opp field history, subscription changes).
