description: A grant proposal on CRISPR base-editing for sickle-cell disease — the hypothesis, the approach, the milestones, and the risk. Built as a decision-grade academic research deck for grant review committee. Use when Codex needs to perform HTML Ppt Zhangzara Monochrome tasks, or when the user explicitly mentions html-ppt-zhangzara-monochrome.

# HTML Ppt Zhangzara Monochrome

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

> Ivory ledger paper with all-black type; Lora serif headlines, Jost body, no color at all.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** light
- **Formality:** high
- **Density:** high
- **Slides in demo:** 16

## Best for

Anything that should feel like a hand-typeset ledger: user research synthesis, white papers, longform reports, academic and policy briefs, advisory deliverables, bilingual EN/CN reports. Equally good for tech, design, or brand decks that want their words to be the only thing on the page.

## Avoid for

Decks that need visual personality or color-led storytelling — the all-ink palette is intentionally austere.

## Workflow

1. **Clone `example.html`** into the user's workspace as the working file.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.
