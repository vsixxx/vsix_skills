name: eng-runbook
description: An engineering runbook — service overview, alerts table, dashboards links, common procedures with copy-pasteable commands, on-call rotation, and an incident-response checklist. Use when the brief mentions "runbook", "ops doc", "on-call guide", "SRE doc", or "运维手册".

# Eng Runbook

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

Produce a single-page engineering runbook.

## Workflow

1. Read DESIGN.md.
2. Identify the service from the brief.
3. Layout:
   - Header: service name, owner team, severity tier, version.
   - Service summary paragraph + dependency list.
   - Alerts table: alert name / severity / what it means / first response.
   - Dashboards & links list.
   - Common procedures block (3–4) with code blocks (deploy, rollback, rotate keys).
   - On-call rotation table (week / primary / secondary / backup).
   - Incident response checklist (5 numbered steps).
4. One inline `<style>`, semantic HTML, monospace for code blocks.
