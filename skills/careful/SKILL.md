# Careful

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

## When to invoke this skill

Warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE,
force-push, git reset --hard, kubectl delete, and similar destructive operations.
User can override each warning. Use when touching prod, debugging live systems,
or working in a shared environment. Use when asked to "be careful", "safety mode",
"prod mode", or "careful mode".

# /careful — Destructive Command Guardrails

Safety mode is now **active**. Every bash command will be checked for destructive
patterns before running. If a destructive command is detected, you'll be warned
and can choose to proceed or cancel.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"careful","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## What's protected

| Pattern | Example | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|
| `rm -rf` / `rm -r` / `rm --recursive` | `rm -rf /var/data` | Recursive delete |
| `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` | `DROP TABLE users;` | Data loss |
| `TRUNCATE` | `TRUNCATE orders;` | Data loss |
| `git push --force` / `-f` | `git push -f origin main` | History rewrite |
| `git reset --hard` | `git reset --hard HEAD~3` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `git checkout .` / `git restore .` | `git checkout .` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `kubectl delete` | `kubectl delete pod` | Production impact |
| `docker rm -f` / `docker system prune` | `docker system prune -a` | Container/image loss |

## Safe exceptions

These patterns are allowed without warning:
- `rm -rf node_modules` / `.next` / `dist` / `__pycache__` / `.cache` / `build` / `.turbo` / `coverage`

## How it works

The hook reads the command from the tool input JSON, checks it against the
patterns above, and returns `permissionDecision: "ask"` with a warning message
if a match is found. You can always override the warning and proceed.

To deactivate, end the conversation or start a new one. Hooks are session-scoped.
