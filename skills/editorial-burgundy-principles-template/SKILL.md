# Editorial Burgundy Principles Template

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

A three-slide editorial deck for culture narratives, strategy storytelling, and internal manifestos.

```text

```

## Workflow

1. Start from `assets/template.html`.
2. Keep the 3-slide sequence:
   - numeric headline
   - studio tags + title lockup
   - eight-principles card grid
3. Replace copy while preserving card and tag hierarchy.
4. Keep interactions:
   - Prev / Next buttons
   - dot navigation
   - keyboard navigation (`ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight`)
5. Keep HTML self-contained and sandbox-safe.

## Output contract

Emit one concise orientation sentence and one HTML artifact:

```xml
<artifact identifier="editorial-burgundy-principles" type="text/html" title="Editorial Burgundy Principles Deck">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```
