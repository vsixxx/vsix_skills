# Investment Banking User Context

This skill owns the Investment Banking plugin's local codexpp-investment-banking-user-context storage foundation and explicit-only onboarding contract. It is intentionally narrow: it can initialize, inspect, save, update, forget, export, or explicitly reset local context, interpret the next onboarding action, guide the four-step intro/defaults -> connectors/plugins -> automation -> hero-workflow flow, and configure user-approved automations. Its read-only preflight does not inspect connectors, route sources, or create automations.

## State Files

Store Investment Banking state under:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/state/plugins/oai-maintained-plugins/investment-banking/
```

The storage foundation owns only:

```text
codexpp-investment-banking-user-context.md
onboarding-state.json
```

Do not create `category-state.json`.

## Initialize

When the user explicitly asks to initialize Investment Banking user context, run `python3 skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/scripts/init_user_context_state.py` with the shell working directory set to this plugin's root. Set the working directory before the first attempt; do not probe alternate relative paths.

The initializer creates missing state files from bundled templates and preserves existing files unless the user explicitly requests overwrite behavior.

## Inspect

When the user explicitly asks to inspect saved Investment Banking context, run `python3 skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/scripts/user_context_preflight.py` with the shell working directory set to this plugin's root. Set the working directory before the first attempt; do not probe alternate relative paths.

Use the returned read-only JSON envelope to summarize initialization status, onboarding status, the deterministic `next_action`, the lightweight `onboarding_progress`, and empty memory categories. Treat `codexpp-investment-banking-user-context.md` as user-editable durable context and `onboarding-state.json` as operational scaffolding.

## Save Update Or Forget

When the user explicitly asks to remember, save, update, forget, export, or apply durable Investment Banking preferences or source pointers, follow `skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/references/plugin-memory.md` from the plugin root. Store reusable user-approved context in `codexpp-investment-banking-user-context.md`; keep live mandate details and operational connector state out. Initialize missing state only when a save needs persistence.

## Onboarding

When the user explicitly asks to get started, orient, set up, resume, defer, quiet, or complete Investment Banking onboarding, follow `skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/references/onboarding.md` from the plugin root. Use the inspection helper's `next_action` as the current step and render its `copy_ref` template substantially verbatim. Keep the visible flow to four steps: intro and lightweight defaults, connectors and plugins, one optional automation, then a three-option hero-workflow chooser. Capture broader durable preferences only when the user explicitly asks or supplies them naturally.

## Source Category Vocabulary

`skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/plugin-author-config/source-category-config.json` reserves static Investment Banking source category ids, labels, and preference hints. The read-only preflight exposes those categories as `source_category_plan` and echoes any setup-owned routes already saved under `onboarding-state.json` `connector_confirmation`. Use `skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/references/source-category-runtime.md` from the plugin root for the source-resolution boundary. Preflight does not prove source readiness, select routes, inspect connectors, or create `category-state.json`.

## Optional Automations

`skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/plugin-author-config/automation-config.md` defines the small author-owned automation menu. When the user explicitly asks for a recurring Investment Banking workflow or accepts the optional onboarding automation step, follow `skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/references/automation.md` from the plugin root. Do not create, update, pause, resume, or remove automations during ordinary preflight.

## Reset

When the user explicitly asks to reset Investment Banking user context, run `python3 skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/scripts/reset_user_context_state.py` with the shell working directory set to this plugin's root. Set the working directory before the first attempt; do not probe alternate relative paths.

The reset helper moves active state files into a timestamped sibling backup directory before clearing them from the active state directory.

## Current Boundary

- The Investment Banking router may run `scripts/user_context_preflight.py` as a soft read-only workflow preflight.
- Do not initialize state merely because another Investment Banking skill runs.
- Do not mutate state when running the read-only inspection helper.
- Do not inspect apps, connectors, plugins, `.app.json`, or source readiness during preflight.
- During user-approved explicit Source Setup, follow `skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/references/source-category-runtime.md` from the plugin root.
- During user-approved explicit automation setup or maintenance, follow `skills/codexpp-investment-banking-user-context/references/automation.md` from the plugin root.
- Do not invoke onboarding unless the user explicitly asks to get started, orient, set up, or manage saved context.
- Do not create or modify automations unless the user explicitly asks or accepts the optional automation setup step.
- Do not add, read, or migrate `category-state.json`. The reset helper may back up and clear an older copy during an explicit reset.
