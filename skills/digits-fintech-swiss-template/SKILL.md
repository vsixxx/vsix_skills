# Digits Fintech Swiss Template

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

A premium three-slide live-artifact template for data-storytelling in a Swiss grid language.

```text

```

## Workflow

1. Start from `assets/template.html` and keep the three-slide structure intact.
2. Replace copy and metric values while preserving card hierarchy and reading order.
3. Keep interactions:
   - Prev / Next buttons
   - keyboard navigation (`ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight`)
   - dot navigation
4. Keep motion subtle (slide fade + tiny hover lift only).
5. Keep the file self-contained (inline CSS/JS) with no sandbox-hostile APIs.

## Output contract

Emit one concise orientation sentence and then one HTML artifact:

```xml
<artifact identifier="digits-fintech-swiss" type="text/html" title="Digits Fintech Swiss Deck">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```
