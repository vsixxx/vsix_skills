# Daily Task Prep

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:
- Calendar/meetings for today are loaded with brain context per attendee
- Open threads from yesterday are surfaced
- Active tasks reviewed with priority ordering
- Prep briefing is actionable (not just informational)

## Phases

1. **Load calendar.** Check today's meetings. For each: load attendee brain pages, recent timeline, open threads.
2. **Check yesterday's threads.** Search brain for yesterday's timeline entries. Flag anything unresolved.
3. **Review active tasks.** Load `ops/tasks` from brain. Surface P0 and P1 items.
4. **Compile prep briefing.** Per-meeting context cards + open threads + task priorities.

## Output Format

```
Morning Prep — {date}
======================
Meetings today: {N}

## {Meeting 1 title} at {time}
Attendees: {names with brain context}
Context: {recent interactions, open threads}
Prep: {what to know before this meeting}

## Open Threads
- {thread from yesterday, with context}

## Tasks (P0-P1)
- {task with priority}
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Listing meetings without loading attendee context from brain
- Ignoring yesterday's unresolved threads
- Presenting tasks without priority ordering
