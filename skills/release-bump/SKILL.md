description: Use this skill to finalize a release. It stamps the [Unreleased] changelog section with a version and date, runs bumpversion to update all version files, and creates the release commit and tag. Only run this when you're ready to ship. Use when Codex needs to perform Release Bump tasks, or when the user explicitly mentions release-bump.

# Release Bump

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

## Goal

Finalize the changelog draft, bump the version across all tracked files, and create a tagged release commit. After this skill runs, the repo has a clean release commit and tag ready to push.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- `bumpversion` installed (`pip install bumpversion` or available in the project venv).
- The `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` should already contain the release narrative. If it's empty or stale, run the `draft-release-notes` skill first.

## Workflow

1. **Verify the working tree is clean** (except `CHANGELOG.md` which may have the draft).

   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```

   Only `CHANGELOG.md` (and optionally `.agents/` files) should be modified. If there are other uncommitted changes, stop and ask the user to commit or stash them first.

2. **Determine the bump level.**

   Ask the user if not specified: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. Check the current version:

   ```bash
   grep '^current_version' .bumpversion.cfg
   ```

3. **Stamp the changelog.**

   Read the current `[Unreleased]` content from `CHANGELOG.md`. Compute the new version (based on bump level and current version). Then:

   a. Replace the `## [Unreleased]` section body with an empty placeholder.
   b. Insert a new stamped section immediately after `## [Unreleased]`:

   ```markdown
   ## [Unreleased]

   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   <the content that was in [Unreleased]>
   ```

   c. Update the reference links at the bottom of the file:
   - Change the `[Unreleased]` link to compare against the new tag
   - Add a new link for the new version

   ```markdown
   [Unreleased]: https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/compare/vX.Y.Z...HEAD
   [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/compare/vPREVIOUS...vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. **Stage the changelog.**

   ```bash
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   ```

5. **Run bumpversion.**

   ```bash
   bumpversion --allow-dirty <patch|minor|major>
   ```

   The `--allow-dirty` flag is needed because `CHANGELOG.md` is already staged. bumpversion will:
   - Update version strings in all tracked files (see `.bumpversion.cfg`)
   - Create a commit with message `Bump version: X.Y.Z -> A.B.C`
   - Create a tag `vA.B.C`

   The staged `CHANGELOG.md` will be included in this commit automatically.

6. **Verify results.**

   ```bash
   git show --name-only --stat HEAD
   git tag --list "v*" --sort=-v:refname | head -n 5
   ```

   Confirm the commit contains:
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `.bumpversion.cfg`
   - `tauri/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
   - `tauri/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
   - `package.json`
   - `app/package.json`
   - `tauri/package.json`
   - `landing/package.json`
   - `web/package.json`
   - `backend/__init__.py`

   Confirm the new tag exists.

7. **Do NOT push** unless the user explicitly asks. Report the tag name and suggest:

   ```
   Ready to push. When you're ready:
     git push origin main --follow-tags
   ```

## Version Calculation Reference

Given current version `X.Y.Z`:
- `patch` -> `X.Y.(Z+1)`
- `minor` -> `X.(Y+1).0`
- `major` -> `(X+1).0.0`

## Error Recovery

- If bumpversion fails, the tag won't exist. Fix the issue and re-run — bumpversion is idempotent as long as the tag doesn't already exist.
- If you need to undo a release commit (before pushing): `git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git reset --soft HEAD~1`
- Never amend a release commit that has been pushed.

## Notes

- When the tag is pushed, the release CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) automatically extracts the matching version section from `CHANGELOG.md` and uses it as the GitHub Release body. No manual copy-paste needed.
- The release commit message is controlled by `.bumpversion.cfg` (`Bump version: X.Y.Z -> A.B.C`). Do not override it.
- If you need to manually update the GitHub Release body after the fact: `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file <(sed -n '/## \[X.Y.Z\]/,/## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)`
