# Apollo User Guide

Use this as the Apollo-specific guide whenever the user or workflow is using Apollo for prospecting, company discovery, Company Details, contact or account enrichment, existing sequence lookup, sender planning, account/contact create-update workflows, or approved outbound launch actions. Keep the surrounding Sales workflow authoritative for the seller task itself; this guide adds Apollo credit gates, identifier handling, mutation safety, and sequence launch safeguards.

Do not use this guide when the workflow uses another enrichment provider or no Apollo connector.

## Skill Configuration

### User Context

Mandatory pre-answer gate: Invoke `sales:codexpp-sales-user-context` in preflight mode by loading `[$sales:codexpp-sales-user-context](../codexpp-sales-user-context/SKILL.md)` and running its preflight script before answering, searching connectors, retrieving evidence, or drafting output. Do not look for a callable MCP tool named `sales:codexpp-sales-user-context`. Use the returned `sales_preflight` envelope as authoritative for saved context, source-category mapping, final obligations, and conditional guidance. Do not read or reinterpret raw Sales state files unless preflight fails, local shell access is unavailable, or the user explicitly asks for raw state inspection.

Use returned user context only as a relevance hint for ICP, territory, persona, terminology, and preferred output style. Do not let saved context replace Apollo identifiers, Apollo-supported filters, connector-returned facts, explicit user constraints, or approval gates.

### Audience And Language

Write for Sales users, not plugin maintainers. This applies to final answers, setup/status readbacks, failure explanations, tool preambles, and mid-turn progress narration.

Translate implementation work into practical Sales impact: what Sales is checking, setting up, saving, or preparing, and why it matters. Avoid implementation terms such as preflight, state file, cache, raw connector id, heartbeat, targetThreadId, schema, API, runtime, metadata, and provider taxonomy unless the user asks for debugging details.

### Source Links

When referencing sources inline, prefer clickable Markdown links over plain bracket labels whenever the source exposes a useful URL. Use the source title, record name, channel/thread, or meeting/date as the link text, for example a clickable Markdown link whose visible text is `Meeting notes: May 19` or `Slack thread: May 15-21`. Use plain text labels only when no useful URL or stable connector-visible link is available, and say `(no useful link available)` when that absence matters.

## Connector Boundary

Choose the narrowest Apollo lane that fits the request. Use the live Apollo tool schema; do not invent replacement tools when a named action is unavailable.

- Identity and Apollo credit awareness: user profile and credit usage reads.
- Discovery: People Search, Contact Search, Organization Search, existing sequence search, and email account lookup.
- Company Details and enrichment: organization enrichment, bulk organization enrichment, people enrichment, bulk people enrichment, and organization job postings when exposed.
- Account/contact records: account create-update, contact create-update, and bulk account/contact create-update when exposed.
- Sequences and launch: sequence search, sequence create-update when exposed, schedule lookup when exposed, sender account lookup, sequence approval or activation when exposed, add contacts to sequence, and remove or stop contacts from sequences.
- Analytics: read-only Apollo sales analytics reports when relevant.

Do not present Apollo as CRM ground truth. Apollo can support prospecting, enrichment, contactability, account/contact record preparation, and outbound sequence work; CRM-owned customer status, opportunity facts, ownership, and forecast truth should still come from the selected CRM when available.

## Credit-Aware Behavior

Say "Apollo credit," not "API credit."

Before broad, open-ended, or credit-consuming Apollo work, make the scope and likely Apollo credit exposure visible and get explicit approval. Credit-consuming actions commonly include Organization Search, Company Details or organization enrichment, people enrichment, bulk enrichment, job postings, and any other Apollo tool whose live description says it consumes credits.

Use free or lower-cost narrowing steps first when practical:

1. Search or resolve the working set.
2. Show a compact preview of the candidates, filters, and count.
3. Ask for approval before credit-consuming enrichment or Company Details.
4. Enrich only the selected or materially useful rows.

Do not add unnecessary friction for a small, clearly requested lookup when the live tool policy already permits it, but still mention Apollo credit use when the action consumes meaningful credits.

## Search And Resolution

### People And Contacts

- Use People Search for net-new prospects in Apollo's database. It should not be treated as returning raw email addresses or phone numbers unless the live tool response explicitly does so and the user has asked for contactability.
- Use Contact Search for contacts already added to the team's Apollo account.
- Combine title, seniority, company/domain, location, technology, company size, and revenue filters when they improve precision.
- If the user's persona phrase is ambiguous, state one concise assumption instead of stopping.
- For broad role families, prefer one well-scoped search with combined title variants when the schema supports it; split only when the first pass is sparse or off-target.
- Do not infer missing emails, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles, or confidence scores.

### Companies

- Prefer domains, Apollo organization IDs, or exact company names plus location/industry when resolving companies.
- For company-only discovery, preview the filters and possible Apollo credit exposure before running a credit-consuming company search.
- Keep company-only results company-only: do not add people columns, contactability labels, or outreach actions unless the user separately asks for contacts.
- If name-only rows are ambiguous, leave them unresolved or ask for domains rather than guessing.

### Identifiers

Use Apollo-returned IDs internally when a downstream Apollo action requires them. Do not fabricate account IDs, contact IDs, organization IDs, person IDs, sequence IDs, sender account IDs, schedule IDs, preview keys, or confirmation flags.

Do not expose internal IDs in ordinary seller-facing output unless the user is explicitly debugging an Apollo integration, validating MCP behavior, or preparing an admin handoff that needs exact identifiers.

## Enrichment And Company Details

Use Company Details language for Apollo organization enrichment when it produces firmographic context such as employees, industry, location, description, funding, revenue, corporate phone, or related company facts.

For People to Company Details:

1. Convert the seller's ICP into focused people filters.
2. Run the appropriate people or contact search.
3. Show the people table first.
4. Offer Company Details as the next step.
5. Preview the selected company domains or organizations and Apollo credit exposure.
6. Ask for explicit approval.
7. After approval, run Company Details and show the combined table.

For people enrichment:

- Prefer the strongest available identifiers: Apollo person ID, business email, LinkedIn URL, domain plus name, or company plus name.
- Bulk people enrichment should stay within the live tool's batch size and should be limited to the rows the user needs.
- Keep `reveal_personal_emails` false by default. Use any personal-email or phone reveal option only when the user explicitly asks, the live tool policy supports it, and the action is lawful and appropriate for legitimate B2B work.

## Mutations

Account/contact create-update tools are mutation-risk tools. Use them only after a reviewed preview and explicit confirmation.

Before account/contact creates:

- Normalize the proposed records.
- Show key fields and the intended action.
- Warn that Apollo may create duplicates when dedupe is not supported or not enabled.
- Use dedupe options when the live tool supports them unless the user explicitly asks not to.

Before account/contact updates:

- Require verified existing Apollo account/contact IDs from prior tool results or clear user-provided IDs.
- Show a field-level before/after diff.
- Send only intended changed fields.
- Never use create/update tools for search, preview, analysis, or draft-only requests.

If bulk account/contact tools are exposed, apply the same preview, duplicate-risk, ID, and confirmation gates to the full batch. Do not split a risky batch into multiple mutations to bypass review.

## Sequences And Launch

Separate drafting, creation/update, enrollment, activation, and sending. Never bundle launch-risk actions together.

Ordinary seller-safe sequence work may include:

- Searching existing sequences by name or audience.
- Reviewing or drafting sequence content in chat.
- Looking up sender accounts for planning.
- Inspecting schedules when a read-only schedule lookup is exposed.

Mutation or launch-risk sequence work requires explicit approval after a preview or diff:

- Sequence creation or update, when exposed, requires a reviewed payload. Default new sequences to inactive when the live schema supports an active flag.
- Sequence update requires a verified existing sequence ID, current state, a clear diff, and explicit confirmation.
- Sequence approval, activation, or campaign approval is critical launch risk and requires a separate explicit confirmation. Never activate by default.
- Adding contacts to a sequence can send real emails. First search and disambiguate the sequence, retrieve valid sender email accounts, show the sender, sequence name, number of contacts, and active/paused enrollment status, then wait for explicit confirmation before enrolling.
- Removing or stopping contacts from sequences requires verified contact IDs, verified sequence IDs, the mode, and confirmation. For stop actions, capture the stop reason when the live schema requires or benefits from it.

Do not enroll contacts, activate sequences, approve campaigns, or start sending unless the user has approved that exact reviewed action and the live Apollo tool supports it.

## Safety Rules

- No raw personal email or phone reveal by default.
- No Apollo credit-consuming Company Search, Company Details, people enrichment, organization enrichment, bulk enrichment, or job-posting lookup without making Apollo credit exposure visible and getting approval when the action is broad, batch, Company Details, or otherwise material.
- No account/contact mutation without preview and explicit approval.
- No sequence creation, update, activation, approval, enrollment, removal, stopping, or sending without the relevant reviewed workflow gate.
- No generic "high Buying Intent" claims unless Apollo returns a supported intent or signal field that matches the user's requested concept.
- No production-readiness claims from local, mock, prototype, or simulation evidence.
- Preserve safe partial work when a request is blocked: show the search, preview, draft, diff, or planning step that can be done safely.

## Output Rules

Use seller language:

- Say "Company Details," not "account context."
- Say "Apollo credit," not "API credit."
- Say "sequence draft," "inactive sequence," "reviewed diff," "enrollment confirmation," or "activation confirmation" precisely.

Prefer compact tables:

- People Search: First, Last, Title, Company, Domain, Location, Email Availability, Phone Availability.
- People plus Company Details: First, Last, Title, Company, Domain, Employees, Industry, Location, Description, Email Availability, Phone Availability.
- Company Search or company-only: Company, Domain, Employees, Industry, Location, Description.
- Existing sequences: Name, Active, Archived, Steps, Max Emails Per Day.
- Sender accounts: Sender Account, Active, Verified, Warmup.
- Batch preview: Record, Key Fields, Risk, Action.
- Batch update diff: ID Source, Record, Field, Current, Proposed.

Keep sourced facts separate from `Inference:`. If a requested row or field is not returned, say so instead of filling it in.

Avoid raw tool names in seller-facing prose unless the user is explicitly discussing MCP validation, evals, implementation, or admin troubleshooting.
