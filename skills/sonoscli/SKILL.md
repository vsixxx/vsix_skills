# Sonoscli

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

Use `sonos` to control Sonos speakers on the local network.

## Quick start

- `sonos discover`
- `sonos status --name "Kitchen"`
- `sonos play|pause|stop --name "Kitchen"`
- `sonos volume set 15 --name "Kitchen"`

## Common tasks

- Grouping: `sonos group status|join|unjoin|party|solo`
- Favorites: `sonos favorites list|open`
- Queue: `sonos queue list|play|clear`
- Spotify search (via SMAPI): `sonos smapi search --service "Spotify" --category tracks "query"`

## Notes

- If SSDP fails, specify `--ip <speaker-ip>`.
- Spotify Web API search is optional and requires `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`.
- If there is an error, check the troubleshooting section and offer advice if there is a decent match.

## Troubleshooting

### `sonos discover` - `no route to host`

- On error `Error: write udp4 0.0.0.0:64326->239.255.255.250:1900: sendto: no route to host (Command exited with code 1)`
  - Note that the port number after `0.0.0.0:` is ephemeral and will change and the netmask may not match exactly either
  - The `sendto: no route to host` should stay consistent
- Advise the user that in `direct` (no Docker sandbox) mode on Mac OS that Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Local Network will need to be enabled for the top-level host parent process of the Gateway
  - `node` if running via `launchd`
  - `Terminal` if running the gateway directly in the terminal
  - `Visual Studio Code` if running via terminal in VS Code
- An alternative option is to use `sandbox` (docker container) with network access allowed for that sandbox

### `sonos discover` - `bind: operation not permitted`

- On error `Error: listen udp4 0.0.0.0:0: bind: operation not permitted`
- Advise the user that they may be running via a Codex or other sandbox that does not permit network access (this can be replicated by running `sonos discover` within a Codex CLI session with sandbox enabled and not approving the escalation request)
