# Saas Landing

## Codex compatibility

Use the tools available in the current Codex environment. Treat Hermes-specific tool names as capability labels and map them to the closest available Codex tool. When upstream instructions use `HERMES_SKILL_DIR`, resolve it to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume that environment variable exists. Follow Codex sandbox, approval, and file-editing rules. Preserve the upstream workflow unless it conflicts with higher-priority instructions.

Produce a single-page SaaS landing. Agent, follow this workflow exactly.

## 1. Read context

Before writing anything:
- Read `DESIGN.md` in the current working directory. If missing, stop and ask for one.
- Identify the color palette, typography tokens, and layout principles.
- Note the "Agent Prompt Guide" section — it overrides any instruction here if they conflict.

## 2. Plan sections

Required sections, in order:
1. **Hero** — logo-or-wordmark, headline (tagline input), subhead (1–2 sentences), primary CTA, secondary CTA. Use the hero_density parameter as vertical padding in px.
2. **Features** — 3–6 feature tiles. Each: icon, short title, 1–2 sentence body.
3. **Social proof** — `proof_count` logos or testimonials. If 0, skip this section.
4. **Pricing** — 2–3 tiers. Include only if `has_pricing` is true.
5. **Footer CTA** — large accent-colored band with one-button call to action.
6. **Footer** — minimal: links + copyright.

## 3. Apply design system

- All colors must come from DESIGN.md tokens. Do not invent hex values.
- Typography: use the declared display font for headlines, body font for everything else.
- Layout: respect the grid, max-width, and section spacing rules.
- Components: use declared button/card/input patterns. Do not add shadows if DESIGN.md's Depth & Elevation says minimal.
- Accent: use the accent color only once in the hero, once in the footer CTA, and for all links. Do not flood the page.

## 4. Write the file

Output a single self-contained `index.html` with:
- All CSS inlined in a `<style>` block in `<head>`.
- System font fallbacks if DESIGN.md fonts aren't loadable from Google Fonts etc.
- No external JS.
- Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- Each editable element tagged with `data-od-id="<unique-slug>"` so the host app's comment mode can target it.

## 5. Self-check

Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] All text is content-meaningful, not lorem ipsum (use product_name and tagline inputs; generate plausible specific copy for the rest).
- [ ] No broken color references (every CSS color value is in DESIGN.md's palette or a valid alpha/fallback variant).
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints match DESIGN.md's Responsive Behavior section.
- [ ] The page looks good at 1440w, 768w, and 375w (mentally simulate).
- [ ] Accent used no more than twice total.

## 6. Done

Write only `index.html`. Do not generate a separate CSS file, JS file, or README.

## For skill authors reading this as a reference

This is a minimal but complete skill. Structure:

```
saas-landing-skill/
├── SKILL.md    ← you are here
└── assets/
    └── base.html    (optional starter template; this skill doesn't use one)
```

Things to notice:
- The `od:` front-matter block is optional for Claude-Code-only compatibility, but adding it lights up OD's typed inputs, sliders, preview metadata, and capability gating.
- The workflow below the front-matter is plain Markdown that the agent reads as its system prompt.
- DESIGN.md is treated as a collaborator, not an override. The skill gives the agent authority to override when the brief conflicts, but never to invent new tokens.
- `data-od-id` tagging is how we wire elements to comment mode. Skills that want comment-mode compatibility must annotate their output.

See [`../../docs/skills-protocol.md`](../../docs/skills-protocol.md) for the full protocol.
